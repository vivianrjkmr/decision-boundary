# Voronoi-based decision boundaries

This repository contains notebooks to supplement my [blog post](https://vivianrjkmr.github.io/2020/09/01/decision-boundary-visualization) on decision boundary plotting for high-dimensional data.

### Project structure

This project contains two Jupyter notebooks and a utility script. They are organised as follows.

```
.
├── Decision boundary plotting.ipynb    # notebook for decision boundary plotting
├── Voronoi diagram.ipynb               # notebook for Voronoi illustration
├── utils.py                            # utility script containing helper functions for plotting
└── README.md
```
