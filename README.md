# Voronoi-based decision boundaries

This repository contains notebooks to supplement my [blog post](https://vivianrjkmr.github.io/2020/06/08/decision-boundary-plotting/) on decision boundary plotting for high-dimensional data.

### Project structure

This project only contains two Jupyter notebooks. They are organised as follows.

```
.
├── Decision boundary plotting.ipynb    # notebook for decision boundary plotting
├── Voronoi diagram.ipynb               # notebook for Voronoi illustration
└── README.md
```
